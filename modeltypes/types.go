// Package modeltypes defines the model layer's value types: the Adapter interface a
// model provider implements, the value types that cross it, the recoverable-fault
// taxonomy, and an in-memory Echo adapter for tests. An adapter turns a transcript
// plus the offered tools into one Response; the router selects among adapters per
// turn. Tool requests use the shared tool.Call type so the loop dispatches them with
// no translation.
//
// This is a type-only leaf: it depends only on the tool package and the standard
// library, so the router and ladder policy that build on it stay dependency-free.
