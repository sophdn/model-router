// The router is an ordered ladder of model tiers (cheapest to strongest). A worker
// rests on its floor rung and climbs ONE rung per escalation edge, descending back
// toward the floor on clean turns. A two-tier {cheap, strong} ladder is just a

// NewLadder, and the strong rung can be usage-bounded via WithBoundedTop so the
// frontier is escalation-only, not reachable per-turn by default.

// Observe returns an Edge describing any transition so the caller can emit its own
// escalation event and record a telemetry row. The router itself stays pure
// (sans-IO): emission is the caller's job.
